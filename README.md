## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.10+** installed  
2. **PostgreSQL 15/18+** installed and running locally  
3. **Required Python packages**:  

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 1 ‚Äî Set up PostgreSQL

Open PostgreSQL and create a new database:
```powershell
CREATE DATABASE women_politics;
```
Update your password in etl/load_data.py:
```powershell
engine = create_engine("postgresql://postgres:<your_password>@localhost:5432/women_politics")
```
## Step 2 ‚Äî Run the ETL pipeline

From the main folder, run:
```powershell
python run_pipeline.py
```
This will:

Extract data from the World Bank API

Transform it to a clean format

Load it into your PostgreSQL database

## Step 3 ‚Äî Run the Streamlit dashboard
```powershell
python -m streamlit run dashboard.py
```
A browser window will open at http://localhost:8501.

You can interactively:

Select a country to see trends over time

Use the slider to see global representation for a specific year

Explore data with interactive charts
